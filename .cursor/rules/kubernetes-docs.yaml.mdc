- Document workloads, services, Helm charts, operators, and CRDs when applicable.
- Include practical **examples**, **code blocks**, and **diagrams**.

## MkDocs Best Practices

- Ensure correct configuration in `mkdocs.yml` (nav, theme, plugins).
- Use modern MkDocs themes that enhance readability (e.g., Material for MkDocs).
- Include **search**, **versioning**, and **navigation** optimizations.

## Markdown Content

- Write in Git-flavored Markdown.
- Use headings, bullet points, and code blocks.
- Include YAML/Kubernetes examples with syntax highlighting.

## QA and Review

- Test documentation navigation and links.
- Validate technical accuracy via `kubectl`, Helm, or test clusters.
- Incorporate developer/user feedback regularly.

## Collaboration and Delivery

- Use Git for version control.
- Write documentation updates in PRs with reviews.
- Integrate MkDocs into CI/CD for deployment automation.
